# Data Structures and Algorithms
Hw1 dealt with implementation of a binary search version of insertion sort and the mergesort algorithm. <br />
Hw2 dealt with implementing a queue of floating point numbers and a doubly linked list with a number of methods. <br />
Hw3 dealt with implementing a hash table using open addressing, populating it, and searching in it. There is also an implementation of a hash table using chaining and Prim's MST algorithm. <br />
Hw4 dealt with the computation of edit distance using dynamic programming. (The edit distance d(x,y) of two strings of text, x[1..m] and y[1..n], is defined to be the minimum possible cost of a sequence of transformation operations that transforms string x[1..m] into string y[1..n].)
