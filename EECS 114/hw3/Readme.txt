hashing.c:
This file is the code for the implementation of hashing with open addressing. It prints the amount of reprobes done for insert and search at 50% and 90% loads. To run this program you must type these commands into the shell in the following order:
1. make hashing
2. ./hashing
3. Enter the size of the hash table (int).
To access the typescript for this program, run the file labeled hashing_script. This script includes the above commands run on a hash table of size 100.

extra.c:
This file is the code for the implementation of hashing with chaining. It prints the amount of reprobes done for insert and search at 50% and 90% loads. To run this program you must type these commands into the shell in the following order:
1. make extra
2. ./extra
3. Enter the size of the hash table (int).
To access the typescript for this program, run the file labeled extra_script. This script includes the above commands run on a hash table of size 100.

prim.c:
This file is the code for the implementation of prim's algorithm for MST. It will save a list of edges and their weights for the two test graphs, dense and sparse, into files called denseMST.txt and sparseMST.txt respectively. To run this program you must type these commands into the shell in the following order:
1. make prim
2. ./prim
To access the typescript for this program, run the file labeled prim_script.
